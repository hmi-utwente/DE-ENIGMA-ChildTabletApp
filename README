This app is used both for the Child Tablet and the Wizard Tablet for the therapist.

There is line that needs to be changed in the AssignmentApplicaiton.java file, line 53.
For the child app it should be:
middleware = new STOMPMiddleware("192.168.1.62",61613,"/topic/CHtablet.command","/topic/tablet.feedback");

For the wizard app it should be:
middleware = new STOMPMiddleware("192.168.1.62",61613,"/topic/ADtablet.command","/topic/tablet.feedback");
